# Füd 
A demo project geared towards food inventory management! Keep track of expiration dates, minimize spoilage, and keep track of your grocery list. 
* Add and delete foods singly or in bulk
* Inputting a new food and want to add an icon from the selector? Type in the selector box to search for a food icon
* Toggle between viewing the foods in your pantry, fridge, and freezer

This project is actively being built! Incoming updates will include integrated Recipe management feature, shopping cart feature, and food metrics.
Füd is currently a desktop-primary app, but mobile-side design is incoming!
